Welcome
=========================================================

Hi, I'm Nancy Carlson, here with my husband Paul Weldon.
    
Our newsletters will keep you updated about our activities 
in ANIM (Attraction - Network - Internet - Marketing). As 
well as our latest interviews for Paul's Place and Nancy's 
Place.

I will also be writing essays about some of the realities 
and possibilities existing for us in today's challenging 
social-economic climate. The text will have lots of juicy 
video and music links and be accompanied with a video 
reading.

Perhaps most importantly we will be providing insightful 
tools and interviews with people who are aware and want 
to help with the transition to a new universal Mind-Shift, 
an awakening on our planet and the creation of a new 
Economic Paradigm.

Thanks for joining and have a great day!
