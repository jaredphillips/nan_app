          <p>Hi, I'm Nancy Carlson, here with my husband Paul Weldon.
						We have been in partnership as a couple for over 36 years. Our merged families include 3 children (Zoe, Matthew and Jeffery) and our grandsons (Cian and Caleb).</p>

          <p>This is our first attempt to venture into the world of Internet Marketing and to be truthful, we are finding ourselves to be strangers in a strange land. It seems our familiar comfort zone has quickly become obsolete. I'm talking about the 'pre-computer' days, when relationships were one-on-one, and a phone call was always answered by a real person.</p>

				<p>Our journey into cyber space is taking us on an adventure that involves absorbing an enormous learning curve dealing with the ominous, omnipotent presence of technology.</p>
	 
				<p>Join us as we share our experiences and opportunities on this very personal and video-rich website.</p>
				 
				<p>Our newsletters will keep you updated about our activities
				in ANIM (Attraction - Network - Internet - Marketing). As well as our latest interviews for Paul's Place and Nancy's Place.</p>
				 
				<p>I will also be writing essays about some of the realities and possibilities existing for us in today's challenging social-economic climate. The text will have lots of juicy video and music links and be accompanied with a video reading.</p>
				 
				<p>Perhaps most importantly we will be providing insightful tools and interviews with people who are aware and want to help with the transition to a new universal Mind-Shift, an awakening on our planet and the creation of a new Economic Paradigm.</p>
